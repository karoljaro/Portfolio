    I'm Karol from Poland, <span class="text-primary-color dark:font-semibold font-bold">I'm fullstack web development with 4+ years of experience.</span> Creating web applications using
    modern frameworks is my everyday passion. I really like to learn new technologies and constantly improve my skills. I have mastered frameworks such as
    <span class="text-primary-color dark:font-semibold font-bold">Vue, Nuxt 3, React </span> and recently I have been dynamically learning Angular. I also pay attention to
    the performance, <span class="text-primary-color dark:font-semibold font-bold">SEO and accessibility</span> of websites. In addition, I have recently started to delve deeper into the
    backend and various technologies related to it. <span class="text-primary-color dark:font-semibold font-bold">Increasing my competences is natural for me.</span>
